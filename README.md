# Example of infinite scroll with Scrapy-Playwright.

- The use of items is included.
- The information is stored in a database (MySQL).

#### Note: In this program we tried to use a while loop persisting in the use of Items, it can be noticed that we also need an item. The latter seems to indicate that this is related to the use of items (the subject will be further investigated) and not to the use of the javascript function to scroll in a "direct" way used in version=1.1.
